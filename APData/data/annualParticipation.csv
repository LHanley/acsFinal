"*This represents the number of schools offering AP Exams to one or more students. Beginning in 2015, the school counts include schools that did not order or administer AP Exams, but had students test at other schools. These schools were not included in prior years' counts. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**This number is slightly inflated because some students take exams in more than one year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
